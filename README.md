# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to uncover insights and trends that can help improve business decisions and strategies. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for data visualization, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

## Tools

For the project, Microsoft Excel, MySQL, and Power BI applications are used.

## Dataset Description

This dataset contain detailed information about pizza orders, including specifics about the pizza variants, quantities, pricing, dates, times, and categorization details.

## SQL Queries

SQL is utilized to query the sales database, extracting  relevant data such as Unit Price, Quantity and pizza specifics. This data is then  cleaned and aggregated to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in pizza sales, such as peak sales times, Percentage sales by size & Category. SQL is first employed to query the sales database, retrieving data on individual seller transactions, sales volumes, and Total Revenue.

## Connect SQL to Power Bi

Connecting SQL Server to Power Bi is an essential step in leveraging the powerful data visualization capabilities of Power BI  to analyze Pizza sales data stored in SQL server. This connection allows for the seamless integration of robust data management with interactive reporting, provide valuable insights into Sales trend, pizzas performance and customerâ€™s pizza preferences.

## Power BI (Reports)

Power BI is employed for visualization, enabling the creation of dynamic dashboards and interactive reports. This data is then processed to calculate key  performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Average Order value, Total Pizza Sold, Total Orders and Average Pizza per order. The combination of SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization provides a comprehensive solution for effective pizza sales analysis.Using Power BI, these KPIs are visualized through interactive dashboards and detailed reports, highlighting the best and worst performers. Visualizations such as Stacked bar charts enable stakeholders to quickly grasp which sellers excel in terms of revenue and customer satisfaction and which ones lag behind. This analysis helps businesses to recognize successful strategies employed by top sellers, provide targeted support and training to underperformers, and ultimately improve overall sales performance and customer experience.

## Conclusion

Gain practical SQL & Power BI Visualization skills through hands-on experience in Pizza Sales Analysis. This analysis helps businesses to recognize successful strategies employed by top sellers, provide targeted support and training to underperformers, and ultimately improve overall sales performance and customer experience.
